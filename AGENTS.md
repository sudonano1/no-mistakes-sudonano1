# AGENTS.md

This file is for agentic coding tools working in this repo.

This repository is a Go CLI app named `no-mistakes`.
The binary entrypoint is `cmd/no-mistakes`.
Most implementation code lives under `internal/`.

**Environment**

- Go version: `1.25.0` from `go.mod`
- Build tooling: standard Go toolchain plus `Makefile`
- CLI/UI libraries: `cobra`, `bubbletea`, `bubbles`, `lipgloss`
- Database: SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite`

- Plain build: `go build -o ./bin/no-mistakes ./cmd/no-mistakes`
- Install locally: `make install`
- Cross-compile archives: `make dist`
- Run unit/integration tests: `make test`
- Run unit/integration tests directly: `go test -race ./...`
- Run end-to-end tests: `make e2e`
- Re-record end-to-end fixtures: `make e2e-record`

Safest local verification sequence after non-trivial changes:

- `gofmt -w .`
- `make lint`
- `go test -race ./...`
- `make e2e` when touching agent integrations, the e2e harness, or recorded fixtures
- `go build -o ./bin/no-mistakes ./cmd/no-mistakes`

**Project Layout**

- `cmd/no-mistakes`: process entrypoint
- `internal/cli`: cobra commands and CLI wiring
- `internal/daemon`: background daemon and run management
- `internal/pipeline` and `internal/pipeline/steps`: orchestration plus review/test/lint/push/PR/CI steps
- `internal/agent`: Claude, Codex, Rovo Dev, OpenCode, Pi, Copilot, and ACP/acpx integrations
- `internal/git`, `internal/ipc`, `internal/config`, `internal/db`, `internal/paths`, `internal/types`: shared infrastructure
- `internal/tui`: terminal UI

**Fork Routing**

- `repos.upstream_url` is the parent repository used for PR base routing.
- `repos.fork_url` is an optional GitHub fork push target.
- `no-mistakes init --fork-url <url>` expects `origin` to point at the GitHub parent repository and `<url>` to point at the contributor fork.
- Plain `no-mistakes init` preserves an existing fork URL on idempotent refresh.
- Push code must use `Repo.PushURL()` so configured forks receive branch updates.
- GitHub PR code must keep `--repo` pointed at the parent and use `--head <fork_owner>:<branch>` when `fork_url` is set.
- GitHub existing-PR lookup must not pass `<owner>:<branch>` to `gh pr list --head`; list by the bare branch and filter the returned head owner fields.
- GitLab and Bitbucket fork MR/PR routing is intentionally out of scope until implemented end to end.
- If a legacy or manually edited row has `fork_url` for GitLab or Bitbucket, PR creation must skip instead of opening a self PR.

**GitLab Backend (`internal/scm/gitlab`)**

- The GitLab `Host` is constructed via `gitlab.New(cmd, cliAvailable, host, projectPath)`, mirroring the GitHub backend's positional constructor. `host` is the repo's GitLab hostname (from `scm.ExtractHost(UpstreamURL)`); `projectPath` is the `group/project` path (subgroups allowed, from `gitlab.ProjectPath` - which lives in the gitlab package next to the `Host` that consumes it, mirroring `github.RepoSlug`). Both are optional; passing `"", ""` reproduces the legacy unscoped behavior used by unit tests.
- glab's flag surface drifts between versions; the backend is pinned against `glab v1.5x`. Two flags bit us: `glab auth status` must be **host-scoped** with `--hostname <host>` (unscoped, it checks every configured instance and fails if ANY has a stale token, falsely reporting an authenticated repo as unauthenticated); and `glab mr list` no longer accepts `--state opened` (open is the default; v1.5x exposes `-c/--closed`, `-M/--merged`, `-A/--all`) - passing the removed flag fails the whole command. When the host is unknown, fall back to the unscoped auth check (fail-safe).
- The daemon operates in a **detached-HEAD worktree** (it checks out the commit, not a branch). `glab ci get` refuses to run there ("you're not on any Git branch (a 'detached HEAD' state)") even with an explicit `--pipeline-id`. Read pipeline jobs via the branch-independent REST endpoint instead: `glab api projects/<url-encoded group%2Fproject>/pipelines/<id>/jobs` (`Host.pipelineJobsArgs`). The legacy `glab ci get` path is kept only as the fallback when no project path is supplied. The `glab api .../jobs` payload carries `finished_at`, mapped into `Check.CompletedAt` (needed for CI re-run detection).

**Documentation**

- Keep `README.md` concise and high-level. The bar needs to be extremely high for what has to show up there.
- Do not put technical details or deep reference material in `README.md`.
- Most documentation should live in `docs/` which is the published docs site.

**Agent-Guidance Surfaces**

- `skills/no-mistakes/SKILL.md` is **generated**, not hand-written: the source of truth is the `body` constant in `internal/skill/skill.go`. Edit the body, then `make skill` to regenerate; `make lint` runs `skill-check` (`genskill --check`) and fails CI on drift. Never edit `SKILL.md` directly. `no-mistakes init` installs/refreshes this same rendering at user level, so the strings in the Go source are what ships to agents.
- The "how an agent drives the pipeline" guidance lives in **three surfaces that must stay in sync**: (1) the skill body above (loaded when an agent invokes `/no-mistakes`); (2) the live `axi` output strings in `internal/cli/axi*.go` - the home `help` (`axi.go`), the gate `note`/`help` and run/respond return help (`axi_render.go` `gateFields`), and the `--help` Long strings (`axi_drive.go`); and (3) the published `docs/src/content/docs/guides/agents.md`. When you change driving guidance in one, mirror it in the others. The point-of-use `axi` strings are the layer an agent reads while driving without reopening the skill.
- Review auto-fix is disabled by default (`config.go` `autoFixDefaults` `Review: 0`; a repo or global `auto_fix.review > 0` override re-enables it through `AutoFixLimit(types.StepReview)` and the executor auto-fix loop), so blocking and ask-user review findings park for an agent decision rather than being silently self-fixed.
  An info-level auto-fix review finding under the default neither parks nor is fixed, so keep the skill, live `axi` note, and docs qualified if you touch review auto-fix.

**Context, Concurrency, and Processes**

- Thread `context.Context` through long-running, subprocess, and networked work.
- Prefer `exec.CommandContext` for subprocesses.
- Route every long-lived subprocess spawned on behalf of a cancellable step/agent invocation through `shellenv.ConfigureShellCommand(cmd)` after building the `*exec.Cmd`.
  It puts the child in its own process tree boundary (Unix `Setpgid`, Windows job object with `taskkill` fallback) and installs `cmd.Cancel` to kill the whole tree on context cancellation.
  Without it, `exec.CommandContext` only kills the direct child and grandchildren survive (e.g. `npm` -> `node` test workers, agent-spawned git/build/editor), keep running, and hold the worktree locked so the next run on the same branch cannot proceed.
  Applied to the step shell runner (`runShellCommandWithEnv`) and the native agent `runOnce` builders (claude, codex, pi, copilot, acpx); apply it to any new subprocess in those paths.
- `cmd.Cancel` only covers the **cancellation** half of the lifecycle.
  On a clean exit (exit 0) or an error return it never fires, so a grandchild that outlived the leader - a test runner's worker pool, a build watcher, a dev server - is **not** reaped.
  This is the agent-spawning test step's failure mode: a repo with no `commands.test` asks the agent to run the tests, the agent's worker pool leaks on every clean run, and the orphans accumulate (each a multi-hundred-MB pool) until the host is out of memory and the OS OOM-killer SIGKILLs the daemon - surfacing on the next start as `daemon crashed during execution` (no Go stack trace, because SIGKILL is uncatchable).
  Use `shellenv.RunShellCommand`, `shellenv.OutputShellCommand`, or `shellenv.CombinedOutputShellCommand` for one-shot commands; they start the command and reap the group on success/error paths too.
  When manual pipe handling is needed, use `shellenv.StartShellCommand(cmd)` and ensure `shellenv.TerminateShellCommandGroup(cmd)` runs as soon as the command is done or the parse loop fails.
  For stdout/stderr parsers that read until EOF, make the Wait owner terminate the group when the leader exits so a descendant holding inherited pipes cannot wedge the parser.
  `startNativeAgentCommand` owns that lifecycle for the native agent runners.
  Group termination is a harmless no-op (ESRCH) when nothing survived.
  `ConfigureShellCommand` also installs a `cmd.WaitDelay` pipe backstop (5s, now on unix as well as Windows) so a grandchild holding an inherited stdout/stderr pipe open after exit can't wedge `cmd.Wait`/`CombinedOutput` forever; it bounds the hang into a graceful step failure instead of taking the daemon down.
  Regressions:
  `TestCodexAgent_Run_ReapsLeakedGrandchildOnCleanExit` (agent path),
  `TestRunShellCommandWithEnv_ReapsGrandchildOnCleanExit` (configured-command path),
  `TestTerminateShellCommandGroup_*` (the primitive).
- Use derived contexts and timeouts for cleanup and HTTP calls.
- Use `context.Background()` mainly at top-level boundaries, background tasks, or in tests.
- Protect shared mutable state with `sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`, `sync.Map`, or `atomic` where appropriate.
- Be explicit about ownership and cleanup of goroutines, worktrees, temp dirs, and channels.

**Filesystem and Paths**

- Use `filepath.Join` and related helpers.
- Respect `NM_HOME` when working with app state.
- Tests should isolate filesystem state with `t.TempDir()` and `t.Setenv("NM_HOME", ...)`.
- Existing code typically uses `0o755` for directories and `0o644` for files such as logs.
- On macOS, remember that path comparisons may need symlink resolution like `/var` vs `/private/var`.

**Git on Bare Gate Repos (`safe.bareRepository`)**

- Agent harnesses (e.g. Claude Code) and hardened CI inject `safe.bareRepository=explicit` via `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`/`GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n`/`GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n`, which forbids cwd-based discovery of bare repositories. Every git operation on a gate repo must therefore name it explicitly: `git.Run` detects a bare git dir (`isBareGitDir`: `HEAD` file + `objects/` dir, no `.git` entry) and prepends `--git-dir=<dir>`; working trees and linked worktrees keep normal discovery. Route gate git calls through `git.Run` - never shell out to git in a bare gate repo relying only on `cmd.Dir` or `-C` discovery (issue #362). Regressions: `TestRunOnBareRepoUnderSafeBareRepositoryExplicit`, `TestWorktreeAddRemoveOnBareRepoUnderSafeBareRepositoryExplicit`, `TestInitUnderSafeBareRepositoryExplicit`.

**Testing Conventions**

- Tests live next to the code in `*_test.go` files.
- Use the standard `testing` package.
- Table-driven tests are common and use `tests := []struct { ... }` plus `t.Run`.
- Use `t.Helper()` in helpers.
- Use `t.TempDir()` for isolated filesystem state.
- Use `t.Setenv()` for environment-dependent behavior.
- Prefer creating real git repos in temp directories instead of relying on heavy mocking.
- Packages whose tests shell out to git unset `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` in `TestMain` so ambient `GIT_CONFIG_*` injection from agent harnesses cannot leak into tests; a test that exercises the injected config re-sets it with `t.Setenv` (see `internal/git`, `internal/gate`, `internal/daemon`, `internal/pipeline/steps`). Follow the same pattern in new git-spawning test packages.
- CLI tests often capture output and assert with `strings.Contains`.
- Prefer e2e tests, new or existing, for behavior that crosses a process or I/O boundary: CLI flags, config loading, git operations, agent spawning, daemon/process coordination, stdout/stderr, and recorded fixtures.
- Unit-test pure helpers and tightly scoped package behavior where speed and failure localization are worth more than full-product realism.
- Prefer targeted package tests while iterating, then finish with `go test -race ./...` and `make e2e` when your change affects those process or I/O boundaries.
- The e2e suite lives behind the `e2e` build tag, so it is excluded from `go test ./...` and runs separately in CI via `make e2e`.
- `make e2e` sweeps both `./internal/e2e/...` (full journey suite) and `./internal/pipeline/steps/...`, so step-local e2e tests (e.g. `internal/pipeline/steps/*_e2e_test.go`, gated by `//go:build e2e`) are also covered. Keep new step-local e2e tests behind the `e2e` tag so `go test ./...` still skips them.

**Repo Config Trust Boundary (security)**

- The daemon runs `commands.*` from `.no-mistakes.yaml` verbatim via `sh -c`, and `agent` selects which process launches (incl. `acp:` targets) with the maintainer's credentials. To prevent supply-chain RCE, the **code-executing selection fields (`commands.{test,lint,format}` and `agent`)** are loaded from the trusted default branch, never from the pushed SHA. See `internal/daemon/manager.go` `startRun` + `loadTrustedRepoConfig`, and `config.EffectiveRepoConfig`.
- `startRun` fetches the default branch, resolves it to an exact commit SHA (`git.ResolveRef`), and `loadTrustedRepoConfig` reads `.no-mistakes.yaml` at that **pinned SHA** (not the `origin/<defaultBranch>` ref name). On fetch failure (or if the ref does not resolve) the trusted SHA is empty → `loadTrustedRepoConfig` returns nil → `EffectiveRepoConfig` forces empty `commands`/`agent`. This fails closed: a stale `origin/<default>` ref left in the shared bare repo by a previous run cannot serve a value the live default branch removed. Regression tests: `TestLoadTrustedRepoConfig_FailClosedOnFetchFailure`, `TestLoadTrustedRepoConfig_PinnedSHAReadsFreshDefaultBranch`.
- Non-executing fields (`ignore_patterns`, `auto_fix`, `intent`, `test`) are still read from the pushed branch.
- `allow_repo_commands` is **per-repo, read from the trusted default-branch copy of `.no-mistakes.yaml`** (declared on `RepoConfig`), never the global config and never the pushed SHA. It defaults `false`; when `true` the maintainer has opted in to honoring the pushed branch's `commands` and `agent` wholesale. A contributor cannot self-enable it from a pushed branch. When changing this logic, keep `commands`/`agent` locked to the default branch and update the e2e test `TestRepoConfigCommandsFromDefaultBranch` (incl. the `pushed_branch_cannot_self_enable` subtest).
- The e2e harness models a trusted single-developer environment, so it commits `allow_repo_commands: true` to the default-branch `.no-mistakes.yaml` via `SetupOpts.AllowRepoCommands`; security tests pass `false` to exercise the secure default.

**CI Monitor Lifecycle**

- The CI step (`internal/pipeline/steps/ci.go`) babysits an open PR until it is merged, closed, the run is cancelled, or `ci_timeout` elapses. It auto-fixes failing checks and rebases on merge conflicts via `autoFixCI`.
- `ci_timeout` is an **idle timeout, not an absolute deadline**: it re-arms (`timeoutAnchor = now()`) every time the upstream default-branch tip advances, so an actively-rebased green PR keeps its monitor no matter how long it stays open. `started` stays fixed for poll-interval/grace-period pacing; only `timeoutAnchor` moves. Re-arm only ever extends the deadline, so a transient base-tip resolution failure is fail-safe. `baseBranchTip` is injectable for tests.
- `config.CITimeout` semantics: `>0` finite, `0` = unset (step falls back to `config.DefaultCITimeout`, 7 days), `<0` = `config.CITimeoutUnlimited` (never self-terminate). Config keyword `ci_timeout: "unlimited"` (also `none`/`off`/`never`) or any non-positive duration resolves to the unlimited sentinel via `parseCITimeout`. Keep `config.DefaultCITimeout` and the `defaultConfigYAML` `ci_timeout` value in sync (`TestDefaultConfigYAML_MatchesGoDefaults`).
- Reap a run by id from outside its worktree with `no-mistakes axi abort --run <id>` (`runAxiAbortByRunID`). It needs only `NM_HOME` + the daemon, not a repo/branch/worktree, because `ipc.MethodCancelRun` → `RunManager.HandleCancel` only cancels runs live in daemon memory. An unknown/inactive id, or a stopped daemon, is an idempotent no-op (`aborted: false`), not an error. This is how an orphaned monitor (worktree torn down before merge) gets reaped deterministically. Bare `axi abort` (no `--run`) stays worktree/branch-scoped.

**Parked / Awaiting-Agent Signal**

- A run carries a pollable "parked, awaiting the driving agent" marker so a supervisor can tell in one `axi status` read whether a run is waiting for the agent to drive a gate versus actively running/fixing/ci. It is **observability only**: it does not change gate resolution, auto-resume, or the `--yes` default.
- Storage: `runs.awaiting_agent_since` (unix seconds, nullable) on `db.Run.AwaitingAgentSince`. `ipc.RunInfo` exposes both `AwaitingAgent bool` (= since != nil) and `AwaitingAgentSince *int64`; `runToInfo` derives them.
- Invariant: `awaiting_agent_since` is non-nil **iff a step is actually parked** at an `awaiting_approval`/`fix_review` gate. The executor (`internal/pipeline/executor.go`) sets it via `db.SetRunAwaitingAgent` on gate entry (right before the step status flips to the gate state, so it is already set once pollers observe the gate) and clears it via `db.ClearRunAwaitingAgent` the moment `waitForApproval` returns - covering both the agent's `axi respond` and a cancel. `RecoverStaleRuns` also clears it so a crash-recovered (failed) run is never reported as parked.
- Surface: the `run:` TOON object adds `awaiting_agent: parked <duration>` right after `status`, rendered only while `AwaitingAgentSince != nil` and the run is non-terminal (`internal/cli/axi_render.go` `runObjectFieldWithKey` + `formatParkedFor`). The render clock is the injectable `nowUnix` package var so parked-duration tests are deterministic.
- Tests: db set/clear + recovery (`internal/db/run_test.go`), executor flips-on-gate/clears-on-respond (`internal/pipeline/executor_approval_test.go`), formatter + render shape (`internal/cli/axi_test.go`), and e2e `TestAxiParkedAwaitingAgentSignal`.

**Rebase Base & Force-Push Safety (data-loss prevention)**

- The whole job of this tool is to not lose people's code. Two invariants protect the rebase/push path; favor failing safe (refuse the push, surface a finding) over any clever recovery.
- **Rebase base comes from the freshly-fetched authoritative remote, never local/stale state.** The rebase step (`internal/pipeline/steps/rebase.go`) fetches `origin/<default>` and `origin/<branch>` (or the fork tracking ref) and rebases onto those remote-tracking refs - never the local default branch.
- **A gated branch must not silently bundle the contributor's unpushed local-default-branch commits.** `detectBundledLocalDefaultCommits` reads the working repo's local `<default>` tip (`Repo.WorkingPath`), and when that tip is ahead of `origin/<default>` **and** is an ancestor of the branch HEAD (i.e. the branch was built on unpushed default-branch work), the step returns `NeedsApproval` + `AutoFixable=false` so a human decides instead of widening the PR. Detection is best-effort: if the local default advanced past the branch point, or the working repo can't be read, it returns nil and the run proceeds. Regression: `TestRebaseStep_DetectsUnpushedLocalDefaultBranchCommits` (#283).
- **Every force-push is lease-guarded against discarding unseen upstream commits.** All force-push sites (`PushStep` in `push.go`, CI auto-fix `pushUpdatedHeadSHA` in `ci_fix.go`) route through `resolveForcePushDecision` (`internal/pipeline/steps/forcepush.go`). It re-reads the live remote head and allows the push only when: the branch is new; the remote already equals the head; the remote still equals `lastSeenSHA` (what the run last observed); or every commit now on the remote is already incorporated **by patch-id** (`git rev-list --cherry-pick --right-only HEAD...current`), excluding history the run is knowingly rewriting (`^baseSHA`, i.e. reachable from the run base - the common amend or reverting the pipeline's own autofix). Anything else returns `forcePushWouldDiscardError` and the caller must NOT push. An out-of-band commit reaches the branch *after* the run base, so it is never an ancestor of `baseSHA` and stays flagged.
- **`lastSeenSHA` must stay the head the run last *observed*, never the live remote tip.** The push step passes the remote-tracking ref the rebase step synced (`lastFetchedBranchTip`); the CI step passes `Run.HeadSHA`. Both callers also pass `Run.BaseSHA` for the `^baseSHA` exclusion. Critically, **the rebase step refreshes `origin/<branch>` only on a normal push, NOT on a force push** - on a force push it skips both the rebase-onto and the fetch, so the tracking ref stays the last-observed head. If it refreshed on a force push, `lastSeenSHA` would equal the live tip, the `current == lastSeenSHA` fast path would pass without the content check, and an out-of-band commit on the branch would be silently clobbered. Anchoring the lease to a SHA read from the remote *immediately before pushing* is the original #281 bug (it always passes and protects nothing); making the rebase always-fetch the branch was the same bug re-created for the force-push path. Never reintroduce either, and never degrade to a bare `--force`/`--force-with-lease` without an explicit anchor when ls-remote/fetch fails (fail closed instead). Regressions: `TestCIStep_CommitAndPush_RefusesToClobberUnseenUpstreamCommit` (#281), `TestPushStep_RefusesToClobberAdvancedUpstreamBranch` (#305), `TestForcePushRun_RefusesToClobberOutOfBandBranchCommit` (force-push fast-path clobber), and `TestResolveForcePushDecision_*`.

**When Making Changes**

- Whenever you must bring in new dependencies, check latest documentation for knowledge, and discuss with the user.
- Always use test driven development for bug fixes and feature development.
